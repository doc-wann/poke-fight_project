# poke-fight_project

About this project: It is a very experimental attempt at creating game mechanics. There is a lot of things added in just so that I could explore what to do with them - In essence, it is a RPG-style fighting game, based on Pokemon. I tried to make it so it could be as easily as possible to add/remove content from the code. In fact, the very first part of the 'game' is simply a map-making and movement prototype. It is further developed in "walker_prototype", also avaliable in my github.

Mainly the project consists of a loop, that switches between enemy and player turn, keeping tracks of their actions and stats. It is no more than a self-tought learning experience, centered around trying to make something I have no ideia how to, from scrath. Cool, right?
